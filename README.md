# Sun Safe

## Overview

Sun Safe is a mobile/web application designed to provide real-time UV index data for different locations worldwide. The app tracks and displays the current UV index of a selected location, helping users stay informed about the intensity of ultraviolet radiation in their area.

In addition to providing UV index information, the application also suggests personalized preventive measures based on the UV levels. For instance, when the UV index is high, the app recommends protective actions such as wearing sunscreen, avoiding direct sunlight, or wearing protective clothing.
